* SimPy Version 4.0.1
* NumPy Version 1.19.5

## Installation and Usage
Clone the repository and use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the packages SimPy and NumPy.
```
pip install simpy
pip install numpy
```
Open [simulation_swdp.py](https://github.com/CarlaHofmann/Simulation_SWDP/blob/205df58c034ee1f98d7eba2e8852f6e500fc16cc/simulation_swdp.py).
